## CoffeeScript Unit Tests

We'll use [Konacha][konacha] to write unit tests for our CoffeeScript.
[Konacha][konacha] relies on the [Mocha test framework][mocha] and [Chai
assertion library][chai] for executing the tests and
[Poltergeist][poltergeist] to run the tests in-memory within a rake task.

First, we add [Konacha][konacha] and [Poltergeist][poltergeist] to the Gemfile:

` Gemfile@e9f6739:18,29

We make sure the `rake` command runs our JavaScript tests as well as our RSpec
tests by adding the `konacha:run` task to the Rakefile:

` Rakefile@e9f6739:8

We configure [Konacha][konacha] to use [Poltergeist][poltergeist] in an
initializer:

` config/initializers/konacha.rb@e9f6739

We create a spec helper and include `application.js`:

` spec/javascripts/spec_helper.js.coffee@e9f6739:1

### Testing `ExampleApp.CurrentLocation`

Our first test ensures that `CurrentLocation#getLocation` returns a location
upon successful resolution:

` spec/javascripts/current_location_spec.coffee@e9f6739:1,10

Next, we assert a default location is returned if the resolution is rejected:

` spec/javascripts/current_location_spec.coffee@e9f6739:12,18

Finally, we ensure `CurrentLocation::DEFAULT_LOCATION` returns the expected
value:

` spec/javascripts/current_location_spec.coffee@e9f6739:20,22

### Testing `ExampleApp.ReverseGeocoder`

To test `ReverseGeocoder#location`, we'll need to stub requests to the
external geocoding service. First we test the success callback is executed if
reverse geocoding is successful:

` spec/javascripts/reverse_geocoder_spec.js.coffee@e9f6739:1,10

We define `ExampleApp.TestSupport.stubSuccessfulGoogleResponse` in our spec
helper:

` spec/javascripts/spec_helper.js.coffee@e9f6739:3,23

We define the `buildGeocoderWithCallback` helper function which returns a
[jQuery Deferred object][jquery-deferred] with the provided callbacks
configured correctly:

` spec/javascripts/reverse_geocoder_spec.js.coffee@e9f6739:20,29

With the assertions complete when testing a successful resolution, we can now
verify `ReverseGeocoder#location` executes the failure callback when reverse
geocoding is unsuccessful:

` spec/javascripts/reverse_geocoder_spec.js.coffee@e9f6739:12,18

` spec/javascripts/spec_helper.js.coffee@e9f6739:25,33

### Testing the Google Map

We avoid testing the Google Map generated by our `ExampleApp.Map` class
primarily because there's no good way to make assertions against the Google
Maps JavaScript API without the tests being very brittle. Instead, we verify
behavior by viewing the application in a web browser and interacting with the
map.
