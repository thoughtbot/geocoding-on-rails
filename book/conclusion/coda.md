Our main goal in writing this book was to provide a guide to working
effectively with geocoded data in Rails applications. As the preceding pages
suggest, working effectively with geocoded data in Rails has two components:
applying sound testing and object-oriented design techniques, and leveraging
free and open-source libraries.

After you've added geocoding functionality to your own project, consider
contributing to the tools that make it all possible. Improve the
[RGeo](https://github.com/dazuma/rgeo) documentation;
add more support for testing
[Geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder);
ensure that [Area](https://github.com/jgv/area) is compatible with Ruby 2.0. You
can also submit pull requests for changes to [this
book](https://github.com/thoughtbot/geocoding_on_rails) if you
find errors.

If you feel inspired, try exploring further possibilities for geocoding with
Ruby and Rails. Grab some geocoded data from [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com/).
Use [D3](http://d3js.org/) and [GeoJSON](http://www.geojson.org/) to create some
amazing maps. Move the geocoding aspects of your application into a service.
