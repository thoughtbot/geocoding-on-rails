### Spatial Queries with PostGIS

[PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) is a powerful spatial database extender for
PostgreSQL. By extending your database with PostGIS, you can persist geographic
objects and write spatial queries using PostGIS functions.

While there are currently few up-to-date resources for using PostGIS with Rails
applications in multiple environments, the challenges of installing and
configuring PostGIS are worth tackling if significant gains in application
performance may be won.

For an example of configuring your Rails application for use with PostGIS, see
Using PostGIS with Rails, Tddium, and Heroku.
