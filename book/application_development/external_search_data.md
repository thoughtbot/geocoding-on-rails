## Search Data Externally

While avoiding requests to third-party services results in faster geocoding
and fewer dependencies, it is often inaccurate. Some postal codes cover
hundreds of square miles; when plotting points on a map or performing a
search, data accuracy is important. By relying on an external service to
geocode data, coordinates become more accurate, searches become more helpful,
and maps provide value.

### Changes to the Controller and View

Instead of converting the search string (a postal code) to coordinates within
the controller, we instead pass the search string directly to `Location.near`,
which will handle the geocoding. Because the Geocoder gem is hitting an
external service, the search string doesn't need to adhere to a specific
format: the service will calculate coordinates as best it can. This removes
the restriction of only searching by postal code, allowing users to search
locations in a much more intuitive fashion.

### Changes to the Model

The model changes in two areas: `after_validation` calls the `#geocode` method
(provided by the Geocoder gem) and the model now considers itself geocoded by
`#address` instead of `#country_code`. Every time we validate the model,
Geocoder makes a request to an external service, updating the model's
coordinates.  While naive, this approach works well and is often more accurate
than geocoding by postal code.
