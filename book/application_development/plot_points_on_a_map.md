## Plot Points on a Map

At this point, all the data has been geocoded; the next step is to display this
information by rendering each location on a map. This allows users to understand
spatial relationships between the data points.

We'll be using the [Google Maps JavaScript API][google-maps-api] to display a
map and plot a marker for each location. Because requests to the Google Maps
API are made on the client side, there are no changes to the controller or
model.

### Changes to the View

Before jumping into querying the maps API, we make some decisions about
how we're going to organize our client-side scripts.

First, we create a namespace for our application:

` app/assets/javascripts/base.coffee@01d053a

Then we create a `javascript.html.erb` partial which will be rendered in the
application layout body:

` app/views/application/_javascript.html.erb@01d053a

` app/views/layouts/application.html.erb@01d053a:10,16

And now we get to the fun part: Creating a `Mapper` to handle drawing and updating
the map.

` app/assets/javascripts/mapper.coffee@5bb8973

We also create a `MapBounds` class:

` app/assets/javascripts/map_bounds.coffee@5bb8973

... and a `Map` class:

` app/assets/javascripts/map.coffee@5bb8973

Finally, in the view we add a function which instantiates a `Mapper` and calls
`addCoordinates()` and `render()` to display a map and plot each location on
page load. We also add a `map` element to the DOM:

` app/views/locations/index.html.erb@59c2f5d:7,33

` app/views/locations/_location.html.erb@a0c7fab
