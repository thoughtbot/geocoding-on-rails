> "The world is a beautiful book, but it's not much use if you donâ€™t know how to
read." -- Carlo Goldoni, *Pamela*

The human desire to acquire knowledge of the natural world has produced
countless systems for aggregating, manipulating, and representing geospatial
information. In recent years -- now that we're all generally agreed on the
shape of the earth -- it has also produced a lot of software.

Working with geocoded data within the context of a web application can be
tricky. While the availability of free and open-source libraries has greatly
simplified the challenges of accurately geocoding data and performing meaningful
analysis, there are still a plethora of decisions to be made before the
first line of code is written: *What tools should we use? Where should the
business logic live? What's the best way to write a test for this?* And after
the feature has been built, *Is it fast enough?*

Geocoding on Rails is a resource for developers seeking an object-oriented,
test-driven approach to working with geocoded data within Rails
applications. It is divided into five sections:

1. **[Strategies](#strategies)** for selecting an external geocoding service
2. **[Tools](#tools)** you should consider using
3. **[Application Development](#application_development):** How to organize your code as you're developing
  features
4. **[Improving Application Performance](#improving_application_performance)** with caching and other techniques
5. **[Testing](#testing)** techniques for your server-and client-side code

**Example Application**

The code samples in this book come from commits in the [bundled example
application](#). The example application is a Rails app which lets users search
for Starbucks locations nearby. Take a look at the [README](#) for instructions
on setting it up.
