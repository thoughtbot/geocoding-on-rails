# Introduction

<<[introduction/introduction.md]

This sample contains a few hand-picked sections covering various aspects of
application development and performance improvements: plotting points on a
map, geocoding browser requests from the server and caching results from
external requests. Because these sections are pulled directly from the book,
you're able to get a sense for the content, style, and delivery of the
product.

If you enjoy the sample, you can get access to the entire book and sample
application at:

As a purchaser of the book, you also get access to:

* Multiple formats, including HTML, PDF, EPUB, and Kindle.
* A complete example application containing code samples referenced from the
  book.
* The GitHub repository to receive updates as soon as they're pushed.
* GitHub issues, where you can provide feedback and tell us what you'd like to
  see.
