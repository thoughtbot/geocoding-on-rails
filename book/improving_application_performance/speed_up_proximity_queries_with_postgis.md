## Speed Up Proximity Queries with PostGIS

### What is PostGIS?

[PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) is a powerful spatial database extender for
PostgreSQL. Like PostgreSQL, it is free and open source. Adding PostGIS to
your database enables persistence of geographic data and makes it possible to
retrieve the data with spatial queries using PostGIS functions. While an
exhaustive discussion of PostGIS is outside the scope of this book,
its utility as a tool for speeding up database queries is worth mentioning here.

### Why is PostGIS Faster?

PostGIS allows geocoded data to be persisted as points on a plane. Proximity
queries using PostGIS are less expensive than non-spatial queries because
locations, represented as geographic points, can be compared using the Pythagorean
theorem. The Geocoder gem's `.near` method, by contrast, compares geographic
coordinates on the fly using the [haversine
formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).

### How Do I Use PostGIS?

While there are currently few comprehensive and up-to-date resources for using
PostGIS with Rails applications in multiple environments, the challenges of
installing and configuring PostGIS are worth tackling if significant gains in
application performance may be won.

Using PostGIS with Rails requires installing the [ActiveRecord PostGIS
Adapter](https://github.com/dazuma/activerecord-postgis-adapter) and
[RGeo](https://github.com/dazuma/rgeo) gems. To perform proximity searches
using PostGIS, you would add a column to your table of geocoded data to store
a geographic point for each entry. (You would also have to write a rake task
to populate the `geographic_point` column from the latitude and longitude.) You
would use RGeo to configure the ActiveRecord model associated with the table of
geocoded data, and you would write your proximity queries using the `ST_Distance`
and `ST_DWithin` PostGIS functions.
