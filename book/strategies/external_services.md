## External Services

### Choosing a Service

Selecting a geocoding service is best done with an estimate of the daily volume
of requests your application is likely to make in mind. The free geocoding services
offered by [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/)
and [Yandex](http://api.yandex.com/maps/) are appropriate for most cases, but
you can consider subscribing to a paid service if the rate limits are too low
for your needs.

Google and Yandex offer free services with rate limits of 2,500 and 25,000
requests per day, respectively. Client-side requests to the Google Geocoding API
[do not count toward the rate limit](https://developers.google.com/maps/articles/geocodestrat#client).
[Google Maps for Business](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/business/)
is a paid service with a rate limit of 100,000 requests per day. Other good
options for paid services are [Yahoo BOSS](http://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/)
and [GeoCoder.ca](http://geocoder.ca/?services=1) (US and Canada only).

### Calculating Coordinates

Gems like [Geocoder](#geocoder) provide a simple interface for querying an
external service to convert any string to a coordinate. External services vary
in support for points of interest (like hotels and airports rather than addresses)
but will provide results for most types of queries.


```ruby
Geocoder.coordinates('Logan Airport')
# [42.36954300000001, -71.020061]

Geocoder.coordinates('washington dc')
# [38.8951118, -77.0363658]
```

The request results will have varying levels of accuracy depending on the
external service. This is significantly better than relying on [local
data](#local-data) because of the external service's ability to infer information
from the string. However, geocoding with an external service is slower than
geocoding locally - a single request will oftentimes take anywhere from 50ms
to 150ms.
